# Guided projects 
This repository has all of the guided projects I've accomplished.

## Predicting heart disease by KNN project 
###Project Overview:
Develop a Machine Learning project for the binary classification of patients, based on clinical and laboratory data, according to the presence or absence of heart disease. The project will be executed on Google Colab.
###Project Pipeline:
1. Proceed with basic steps of EDA and data pre-processing.
2. Train a predictive model using KNN Classifier and GridSerach.
3. Evaluate a binary classifier using suited metrics.
