# Guided projects 
This repository has all of the guided projects I've accomplished.

## Predicting heart disease by KNN project 
### Project Overview:
Develop a Machine Learning project for the binary classification of patients, based on clinical and laboratory data, according to the presence or absence of heart disease. The project will be executed on Google Colab.
### Project Pipeline:
1. Proceed with basic steps of EDA and data pre-processing.
2. Train a predictive model using KNN Classifier and GridSerach.
3. Evaluate a binary classifier using suited metrics.

## Predicting heart disease by KNN project
### Overview:
Create a data ingestion using Pandas and Numpy, preprocess and visualize the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Also build a binary classification model using Scikit-Learn. Additionally use the data science concepts and techniques such as standardization and up- and down-sampling of biased data.
### Project Steps:
1. Import needed libraries.
2. Data Ingestion.
3. Data Pre-processing.
4. Data preparation.
5. Using PCA Decomposition.
6. Data Scaling.
7. Build a Model by Logistic Regression.
8. Training and Evaluation.
9. Save the Model using pickle.
